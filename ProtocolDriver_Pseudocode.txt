Wait for either ENQ Rx'd or Output Available event
If ENQ Rx'd
	Tx ACK1
	Reset ENQ event
	Wait for Data to be Rx'd
	If Rx EOT or connection timed out
		Return to Idle
	Else If Rx Data
		If Data has valid CRC
			Tx ACK2
			Return to Wait for Data to be Rx'd
		Else
			Do nothing (force retransmission)
Else if Output Available
	Tx ENQ
	Wait for ACK1
	If Rx ACK1
		While there's data to send, the sending limit isn't reached, and retransmit hasn't failed
			Create Packet
			Tx Packet
			If response times out
				While Retransmission Attempts <= 5
					Attempt to Retransmit Packet
				If more than 5 Retransmission Attempts
					Retransmit failed; exit loop
		If Retransmit Failed
			Return to Idle
		Else
			Tx EOT
