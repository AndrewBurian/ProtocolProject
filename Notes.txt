Notes

File bufferer thread:
	started when the user adds a new file to be sent
	loads the file as a stream of bytes into the back of the output cue
	sets output available event
	returns when done
	*should only be able to create one at a time



Serial Reader thread:
	continuously reads the input buffer on the port
		Get SYN
		Get next byte
			if SOT
				get remainder of frame
			else
				get next byte

		error check
		if no errors
			discard SYN
			if data
				add to input cue
				set inputAvailable event
			else
				set appropriate event




Protocol controller thread:
	Handles the protocol engine
	wait for outputAvailable | ENQ
		if output
			enq

		<rest of protocol engine. Have fun>



* All threads should occasionally check for the end of program flag *
* if waiting without timeout, should also wait on the end of program event *
